# Welcome to the instruction of IPcamera based on Raspberry Pi 5!
## Some Basic Introduction
First, we apply the usb camera with Raspberry Pi in our system because it not only has a cheaper price, but also performs very well in many different situations.

Particularly, Raspberry Pi 5 is hot-swappable, which means it is very convenient to adjust and detect the camera if there is something wrong without shuting down the whole system.
